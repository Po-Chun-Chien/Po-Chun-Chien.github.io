* Duration: Sep. 2018 - Nov. 2019
* The [research manuscript](https://b04901112.github.io/publication/2019-11-timeFold) was accepted and published by [ICCAD](https://iccad.com/) 2019.
* This is my first graduate research project instructed by Prof. [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).
* Time-frame folding is the reverse operation of time-frame expansion. It constructs a sequential circuit from an *k*-iterative combinational circuit.
* The constructed circuit is equivalent to the original circuit within the bounded *k* time-frames.
* Empirical evaluation demonstrates its ability in circuit size compaction and suggests potential use in testbench generation and bounded strategy generalization.
