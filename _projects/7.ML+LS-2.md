* Duration: April 2021 -- July 2021.
* This is a programming contest held in the International Workshop on Logic and Synthesis ([IWLS](https://www.iwls.org/iwls2021/)) 2021, which extends, in a fairly significant way, the contest from the previous year 2020.
* The goal is to learn multi-output Boolean circuits (in AIG format) for [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image classification.
* For the learned circuits, 3 different size limits are considered: *small* (≤ 10,000 AIG nodes), *medium* (≤ 100,000 AIG nodes) and *large* (≤ 1,000,000 AIG nodes).
* Our Methods:
  * To learn a *small* or *medium* circuit, we adopt the one-against-one (OAO) approach that construct a multi-class classifier with an ensemble of binary decision trees.
  * To learn a *large* circuit, we train a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) model with grouped convolutions and quantized weights. The CNN model is then synthesized with sub-adder sharing to reduce the circuit size.
* Our team is one of the **top 3** winners of the contest.
