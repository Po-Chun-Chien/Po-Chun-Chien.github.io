* Duration: Sep. 2017 - June 2018.
* This is the final project of the undergraduate course "Digital Circuit Lab" in NTU. I collaborated with 2 other classmates on this project.
* We implemented Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) and various operations in deep neural network via stochastic computation.
* The goal is tp build a neural network with lower hardware cost in terms of power consumption area-delay product on FPGA boards (Altera DE10-nano).
* Our team is one of the **Regional Finalists** in Greater China of [Innovate FPGA](http://www.innovatefpga.com/) 2018.
