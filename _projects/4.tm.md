* Duration: Nov. 2019 - July 2020
* The [research manuscript](https://po-chun-chien.github.io/publication/2020-07-timeMux) was accepted and published by [DAC](https://www.dac.com/) 2020.
* This is my second graduate research project and was the extension of the "[Time-Frame Folding](https://po-chun-chien.github.io/projects/3.tff)" project.
* Time multiplexing (TM) is an important technique to overcome the I/O bandwidth bottleneck of FPGAs.
* Our new formulation achieves TM through structural and functional circuit folding at the logic level.
* Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed structural method and improved optimality of the proposed functional method on look-up-table and flip-flop usage.
