* Duration: July 2020 - present.
* The project originated from the [problem](http://iccad-contest.org/2020/problems.html) A of the ICCAD 2020 CAD Contest.
* The contest goal is to verify the equivalence of 2 low-power netlists, which generate X-value under the power-shutoff behavior.
* The miter circuit is constructed with dual-rail encoding, and is optimized with various techniques.
* We identify the compatible equivalence relations of internal signals, and utilize such information to guide the SAT solver for more efficient equivalence checking.
* The research paper is in preparation for submission is not ready for publication yet.
