* Duration: July 2020 -- July 2021.
* The project originated from the [problem](http://iccad-contest.org/2020/problems.html) A of the ICCAD 2020 CAD Contest.
* The goal of the contest is to verify the combinational equivalence of 2 x-valued (or ternary logic) netlists, with the *X*-values serving as dont cares.
* Ternary logic, consisting of *0*, *1* and *X*, arises in various contexts of system design, where the *X*-value often represents an unknown value or a donâ€™t-care value depending on the application.
* We construct the circuits with *X*-value preserved dual-rail encoding, and apply various optimization techniques.
* We identify the compatible equivalence relations of internal signals, and utilize such information to guide the SAT oracle for more efficient solving.
* Experiments on industrial designs have demonstrated the superiority of our method to other competitive methods.
* The research work was presented in the [IWLS 2021](https://www.iwls.org/iwls2021/).
