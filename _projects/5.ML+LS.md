* Duration: May 2020 - Dec. 2020.
* This is a programming contest held in the International Workshop on Logic and Synthesis ([IWLS](https://iwls20.cade.utah.edu/)) 2020.
* The goal of the contest is to learn an unknown Boolean function from a training set consisting of input-output pairs.
* The learned function is in the form of And-Inverter Graph with strict hardware cost ($\leq 5000$ gates).
* Our Methods:
  * decision tree with fringe-feature detection (left figure),
  * and neural network with connection pruning and activation quantization (right figure).
* Our team achieved the **highest testing accuracy in most (42 out of 100) cases**, and ranked 4th in terms of the average testing accuracy.
* The joint [research paper](https://po-chun-chien.github.io/publication/2021-02-MLLS) with other contestants is accepted by the 2021 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference ([DATE](https://www.date-conference.com/)).
