* Duration: May 2020 - present.
* This is a programming contest held in the International Workshop on Logic and Synthesis ([IWLS](https://iwls20.cade.utah.edu/)) 2020.
* The goal of the contest is to learn an unknown Boolean function from a training set consisting of input-output pairs.
* The learned function is in the form of And-Inverter Graph with strict hardware cost ($\leq 5000$ gates).
* Our Methods:
  * decision tree with fringe-feature detection,
  * and neural network with connection pruning and activation quantization.
* Our team achieved the **highest testing accuracy in most (42 out of 100) cases**, and ranked 4th in terms of the average testing accuracy.
* The research paper is still under revision and is not ready for publication yet.
